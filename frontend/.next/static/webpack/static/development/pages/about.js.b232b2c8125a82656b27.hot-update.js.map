He was born and raised in Austin, TX but enjoys traveling and the great\n\t\t\t\t\tdiversity of the United States. He holds a Full-Stack Web Developer certification from The\n\t\t\t\t\tUniversity of Texas and received a BBA in Finance from Texas State University in 2006. He\n\t\t\t\t\tmost enjoyed his time working for an Entrepreneur running two web stores, which furthered\n\t\t\t\t\this passion for technology and design. He was able to marry skills in coding, graphics\n\t\t\t\t\tediting, Management, Finance, and Business Administration. The demand to approach issues\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom different perspectives and wear many hats at a small business quenched his thirst as an\n\t\t\t\t\tENTP, which rarely pass up the opportunity to learn something new. It was during his time\n\t\t\t\t\tthere he decided to take the necessary steps to switch careers to a more fulfilling and\n\t\t\t\t\tdynamic field.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<br />\n\t\t\t\t\t<p className='bio'>When he isnâ€™t making computers dance, he spends time playing guitar, learning\n\t\t\t\t\tSpanish, running marathons, and trying not to fall down on the soccer field. He is currently\n\t\t\t\t\tworking on coding a website to showcase his many hobbies.
